2) A finalized data visualization (or visualizations) that compare **juvenile hare weights by sex and site (grid)**.
3) A further comparison of mean weights for **juvenile male and female snowshoe hares** included in this study. 
4) An exploration of the relationship between juvenile snowshoe hare hind foot length (variable `hindft`, recorded in millimeters), and weight.
5) A short summary describing the main findings from the juvenile hares exploration.
